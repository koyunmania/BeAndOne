##Adding webapp server: tomcat7##
Eclipse steps: to start app as http://localhost:8080/
1. Add server --> select tomcat7 --> select tomcat7 home --> select webapp.war
2. project-->properties -->web project settings --> update context root value / 
3. restart tomcat

IntelliJ IDEA:
1. Edit configuration -->select tomcat --> local --> select tomcat7 home directory
2. next tab deployment --> add artifacts by clicking on + symbol -->choose webapp.war
3. leave context as blank /
3. start tomcat

OR
#start tomcat7 as services#
Download the binaries of Apache Tomcat
Extract to a location
Open a commandline window and navigate to the "bin" folder where you extracted the binaries
Then run the program "startup.bat"
This will start the Tomcat server.
You need to do this each time when you start developing.
To stop the Tomcat Server, run the command "shutdown.bat".

##Database Installation and Configuration##
Download the PostgreSQL Binaries: postgresql-9.3.5-1-windows-x64-binaries from: "http://get.enterprisedb.com/postgresql/postgresql-9.3.5-1-windows-x64-binaries.zip"
Extract the binaries to a location, such as "D:\Work\Tools\postgresql-9.3.5-1-windows-x64-binaries"
Open a command line window and navigate to the folder "bin" in the extraction folder.
Run the following command:
initdb -D ..\local_data

Then run the command to start the database instance:
postgres.exe -D "D:\Work\BeOne\test\postgresql-9.3.5-1-windows-x64-binaries\pgsql\local_data"
Each time before you start developing, you need to start the database server


Open a Windows Explorer and navigate to the "bin" folder of the extraction folder.
There is a program "pgAdmin3.exe", run the programm. This is an administration tool for PostgreSQL
On the left side, create a connection to the local database. A small configuration window opens.
Enter values as follows:
- Name: Give a representative name, maybe "BeAndOne"
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5432
- Username: Your Windows username (careful with capital letters)
- Password: Your Windows password
- Maintenance DB: postgres
Click on Enter, this opens a connection to the maintenance database.

Now we will create the database for our application.
Click on the "+" sign beside database instance
Then "Databases", then select "postgres".
On the top menu of the window you see the symbol with text: "SQL" 
Click on that, this opens another window to enter SQL commands.
In our project folder "D:\Work\BeOne\webapp\v0.2\database" we have a file "create_user.sql". (this is the path at my computer)
Open this file and execute it. This will create the initial username.
Close that SQL window.
Then you create another db connection with pgAdminIII with the username "beoneuser" with the password: "1234"
Similarly find this new database and click on "SQL" symbol at the top of the window.
In our project folder "D:\Work\BeOne\webapp\v0.2\database" we have a file "create_user.sql". (this is the path at my computer)
Open this file and execute it. This will create the tables for the new database.

You will find these tables at: "Databases->beone->Schema->public->tables"
